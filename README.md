	  server.py and client.py contains codes to run the phase 2 of the project.
	  bmp.bmp is the image file that we utilised in our work.

	- We used VSCode version 1.82.2 on windows.

	- To run the program you need to open two terminals in VSCode, one for
	  server and the other one for client.
	  First you have to run the server.py file.
	  	The console command is : python3 .\server.py
	  Next you have to run the client.py file.
		The console command is : python3 .\client.py
	  After running the client.py, you'll see the progress of the data transferring
	  process between client and server.
